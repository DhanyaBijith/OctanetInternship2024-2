# OctanetInternship2024-2
This is a ToDo list Web page that I created, using html and css.
I have designed it under the guidance of the company Im currently working underas an Intern, Octanet Technologies.
It was a very fun exercise and I learned a lot from the errors I made.
I plan to widen my knowledge in the field of web-development and I have found motivation to work even harder through this internship.
Here, in this code, I incorporated an interactive To-Do List where you can check an item out of the list, once it is done.
And you can edit the names of the items in the list as well.
Thank You
